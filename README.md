# GreenClover-bot

### Using:
You probably don't want to use that bot. It's actually crap maybe I someday rebuild it.

### Bot can:
- join the channel, leave the channel, play the music, EVEN ***stop the music***
- ban users, but can't *un*ban users
- send some gifs of cats, dogs and games
- send some other very funny messages
- send results from google like sites or images and this is quite interesting
  but also has some limitaions. Like only 100 queries per day which is a liiiitle small
- it has profiles and will have probably some currency and bla bla other stuff that other bots have
- maybe it will get photos from instagram one day

and some other cool stuff.

### Bot currently supports English and Polish language :)

### Links:
Discord server: https://discord.gg/ARRy5wN

and some other cool stuff.
