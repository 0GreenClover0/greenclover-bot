# GreenClover-bot

### Using:
You probably don't want to use this bot. It's kinda crap compared to the others, it served me as a project to learn programming, but maybe I will rebuild it someday.

### Bot can:
- join the channel, leave the channel, play the music, EVEN ***stop the music***
- ban users, but can't *un*ban users
- send some gifs of cats, dogs and games
- send some very funny messages
- send results from google like sites or images, it has some limitations though. Like only 100 queries per day which is quite small
- has users profiles

and some other cool stuff.

### Bot currently supports English and Polish languages

### Links:
Discord server: https://discord.gg/ARRy5wN
For now, probably the only public server that uses this bot.

In my bot I'm using:

Lavalink: https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink

Sharplink: https://github.com/Devoxin/SharpLink

Discord.Net: https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net

and some other cool stuff.
